  subtitle: Art print by Juan Hernandez
  detail: Juan Hernandez is an incarcerated artist born and raised in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood. He was incarcerated at the age of 16 and given a juvenile de facto life sentence. A quarter century later he still resides in a prison cell, which he has turned into an art studio, and yields art that is a reflection of his escape from the walls it was created in.

His art has been exhibited at Angelica Kauffman Gallery, Art in Odd Places NYC, and The Design Museum of Chicago, amongst others. His writing has appeared in publications such as Prison Journalism Project and Teen Vogue, and he has received support from The Puffin Foundation and The National Association of Latino Arts and Culture.
